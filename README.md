## Project Name

# Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

This project allows a user to click on any of the movie posters and directs them to a new page to view the movie details. 

I've also added links to the top and bottom of the page to navigate through the app. This app includes a form to add additional movie posters and movie descriptions.

The app is style with Material-UI for change as I've previously utilized CSS to style my projects.

## Prerequisites

- React
- Redux
- Redux-Sagas
- Axios
- Material-UI
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL


## Installation

1. To install, click the green `code` button at the top of this page. Fork and clone repo.

2. Create a database with the information listed in `data.sql` file. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.

2. Open the project in a code editor of your choice and run the following command `npm install` in the terminal. It helps to have split the terminal in 3 tabs, with one being used for git add or commits. 

3. In the second tab you'll need to run `npm run server` 

4. In the third tab run `npm run client`. This will automatically open a new window with localhost.
